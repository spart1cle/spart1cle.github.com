Hello! My name is Brandon May and I'm currently a graduate student at the Rochester Institute of Technology. I'll be graduating in February with a Master's degree in Imaging Science for my research on imaging systems, computer vision algorithms, and virtual environments.

My undergraduate degree is a B.A. in Mathematics and Physics with a minor in Computer Science from Skidmore College.
